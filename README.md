## Aim of our game:

Our game seeks to educate users on ways to approach and deal with people suffering from simple mental health issues such as depression and sadness.

We aligned ourselves to the Psychological First Aid framework by the Ministry of Manpower.

1) Prepare

2) Look

3) Listen

4) Link

We hope that this would spread awareness about mental health issues, as well as encourage those with minor issues to seek help from their peers rather than professionals.

This would in turn help to ease the burden on our already declining population of mental health professionals.

## Storyline:

The main character, the hamster, just enrolled into Pawsitive, a school for animals. 

He is greeted by Principal Brown and is introduced to a useful guide to free mental health services.

As he encounters new friends, he learns to communicate better and helps them resolve their issues.

## About the development:

We built the game on Monogatari visual novel engine. 

The engine comes with a documentation and we had to edit the files in order to accomplish our aim of building an educational game.

The files edited were script.js and a new file called story.js. 

We added our own background pictures, images and sprites into the assets folder.
